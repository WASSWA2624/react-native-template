# Accessibility (a11y) & User Experience (UX) Standards

## Purpose
Make the app **accessible**, **inclusive**, **user-friendly**, and compliant across **mobile + web** without sacrificing performance.
Goals:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- Intuitive and delightful user experience
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Clear feedback and error recovery
- Accessible to users with disabilities

## Accessibility Rules (Mandatory)

### 1. Interactive Elements
- Every interactive element must have an accessible label/hint (`accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`)
- Touch targets must be large enough (minimum 44x44px) and spaced appropriately
- Ensure full keyboard navigation on web
- Support screen readers on all platforms

### 2. User Settings & Preferences
- Respect user settings:
  - Reduced motion (respect `prefers-reduced-motion`)
  - Font scaling / dynamic type (support system font size changes)
  - Dark mode preferences
  - Language preferences (see `i18n.mdc`)

### 3. Visual Accessibility
- Color must not be the only signal (icons/text + semantic status)
- Contrast must meet WCAG AA expectations (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI components)
- Focus states must be visible on web (theme-defined)
- Support system high-contrast / accessibility preferences where available (app has light/dark themes only; see `theme-design.mdc`)

### 4. Content Accessibility
- All images must have alt text or be marked decorative
- Form labels must be associated with inputs
- Error messages must be accessible and clear
- Loading states must be announced to screen readers

## User Experience (UX) Rules (Mandatory)

### 1. User Feedback
**Loading States**:
- Show loading indicators for operations > 500ms
- Use skeleton screens for content loading
- Provide progress feedback for long operations
- Never leave users wondering if something is happening

**Error States**:
- Display clear, actionable error messages (internationalized - see `i18n.mdc`)
- Provide recovery options (retry, cancel, alternative actions)
- Never expose technical error details to users
- Use friendly, helpful language

**Success States**:
- Confirm successful actions with clear feedback
- Use toasts, snackbars, or inline messages appropriately
- Don't overuse success messages (avoid notification fatigue)

**Empty States**:
- Provide helpful empty state messages
- Suggest actions users can take
- Use illustrations or icons to make empty states friendly

### 2. Interaction Design
**Navigation**:
- Clear navigation hierarchy
- Breadcrumbs for deep navigation
- Consistent back button behavior
- Clear current location indicators

**Forms**:
- Clear labels and placeholders
- Inline validation with helpful messages
- Show required fields clearly
- Group related fields logically
- Provide clear submit feedback

**Actions**:
- Confirm destructive actions (delete, remove)
- Provide undo options when possible
- Make primary actions clear and prominent
- Disable actions appropriately (with clear reason if needed)

### 3. Responsive UX
- Mobile-first design (see `core-principles.mdc` Principle #7)
- Touch-friendly interactions (adequate spacing, large targets)
- Optimize layouts for different screen sizes
- Ensure content is readable without zooming

### 4. Performance UX
- Fast perceived performance (show content quickly)
- Progressive loading (show critical content first)
- Smooth animations (60fps, see `performance.mdc`)
- No blocking operations on main thread

### 5. Consistency
- Consistent interaction patterns across the app
- Consistent visual language (see `theme-design.mdc`)
- Consistent terminology (use i18n keys - see `i18n.mdc`)
- Consistent error handling patterns

## Theming & Contrast
- Contrast: WCAG AA; theme tokens must be adjusted if not. Focus states visible on web (theme-defined).
- Support system dark mode preferences (app themes: light/dark only).
- Ensure theme works for color-blind users.

## Forbidden Patterns
❌ Inaccessible interactive elements
❌ Small touch targets (< 44x44px)
❌ Color-only indicators
❌ Poor contrast ratios
❌ Missing loading/error/empty states
❌ Unclear error messages
❌ Blocking UI operations
❌ Inconsistent interaction patterns

## Enforcement
- Accessibility violations block PR approval
- UX regressions must be addressed
- All new features must include loading/error/empty states
- See `i18n.mdc` for i18n
