# Phase 12: Advanced Features

## Purpose
Implement optional HMS capabilities described in `hms-backend/write-up.md`. Each step is **atomic** and covers one advanced capability slice.

## Rule References
- `.cursor/rules/features-domain.mdc` (Feature Template Structure - MANDATORY)
- `.cursor/rules/state-management.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/services-integration.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/errors-logging.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/security.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/offline-sync.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/testing.mdc`

## Prerequisites
- Phase 11 completed (core screens and routes)
- Phase 10 completed (core modules implemented)

## Feature Development Contract
Every advanced feature must follow the feature template structure defined in `.cursor/rules/features-domain.mdc` and reuse core module hooks where applicable.

## Steps (Fully Atomic)

### Telemedicine & Remote Patient Management (Chapter 17)
- Step 12.1.1: Teleconsultation scheduling UI
- Step 12.1.2: Teleconsultation session management UI
- Step 12.1.3: Secure messaging and notification flows for telemedicine
- Step 12.1.4: Remote patient monitoring UI (if backend supports)

### Patient Experience & Engagement (Chapter 18)
- Step 12.2.1: Patient portal dashboard (appointments/results/prescriptions/billing)
- Step 12.2.2: Patient feedback and complaints flows
- Step 12.2.3: Patient education content surfaces
- Step 12.2.4: Patient notification preferences and reminders

### AI-Assisted Diagnostics & Predictive Analytics (Chapter 19)
- Step 12.3.1: AI insights surfaces for diagnostics
- Step 12.3.2: Predictive dashboards (bed occupancy, staffing, readmission)
- Step 12.3.3: Explainability panels and audit visibility for AI outputs

### Clinical Decision Support Enhancements (Chapter 19)
- Step 12.4.1: Medication interaction alert surfaces
- Step 12.4.2: Protocol reminders and guideline support UI
- Step 12.4.3: Escalation workflows for critical values

### Clinical Research & Trials Support (Chapter 19)
- Step 12.5.1: Research cohorts and eligibility filtering UI
- Step 12.5.2: Research consent tracking UI
- Step 12.5.3: Trial documentation dashboards

### PACS, Imaging, and IoT Integrations (Chapters 7 and 19)
- Step 12.6.1: PACS viewer integration surface
- Step 12.6.2: Imaging asset access and sharing UI
- Step 12.6.3: Device and wearable integrations UI (if enabled)

### Advanced Executive Dashboards (Chapters 11 and 20)
- Step 12.7.1: Multi-branch KPI dashboards
- Step 12.7.2: Predictive and trend analytics views
- Step 12.7.3: Custom report templates for leadership

### Nurses Time-table Generator (Write-up §5.17, §12.2.2, §20.3)
- Step 12.8.1: Roster generation UI (rules, constraints, shift types, workload balancing)
- Step 12.8.2: Publish roster, notifications to nurses, export/print shift rosters
- Step 12.8.3: Manual overrides, swap requests, and audit visibility for roster changes

**Testing**: Maintain the same test rigor as Phase 10. Focus on error paths, permissions, and feature gating (modules/subscriptions).
