# Phase 9: App Layouts (All Platforms, All Screen Sizes, Microsoft Fluent)

## Purpose
Implement **app layouts and global UI shell** for all route groups. Layouts and all UI in this phase must be implemented for **all platforms** (Android, iOS, Web), **all screen sizes** (mobile, tablet, desktop, large per `src/theme/breakpoints.js`), and must follow **Microsoft Fluent / Microsoft 365 look and feel** per `.cursor/rules/theme-design.mdc`. Every step is atomic, chronological, and follows `.cursor/rules/`.

## Prerequisites
- Phase 8 completed (debug resources)
- Phase 7 completed (app shell, route groups)
- Theme: light/dark only (Phase 3)

## Rule References
- `.cursor/rules/app-router.mdc` (route groups, layout placement)
- `.cursor/rules/platform-ui.mdc` (platform separation, resilience)
- `.cursor/rules/component-structure.mdc` (grouping, barrel, platform files)
- `.cursor/rules/theme-design.mdc` (Microsoft Fluent, tokens, light/dark only)
- `.cursor/rules/accessibility.mdc` (a11y, touch targets)
- `.cursor/rules/testing.mdc` (coverage, platform-specific tests)
- `.cursor/rules/i18n.mdc` (100% i18n for UI text)

## Layout and Component Requirements (Mandatory)
- **Platforms**: Every layout and global UI component must have `.android.jsx`, `.ios.jsx`, `.web.jsx` (and matching `.styles.jsx`) per `component-structure.mdc`.
- **Screen sizes**: Use theme breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop, large); responsive behavior at each breakpoint; no magic numbers.
- **Look and feel**: Microsoft Fluent / Microsoft 365 (Fluent blue primary, neutrals, Segoe UI–style typography, 2–4px radius, light elevation). All tokens from theme; no hardcoded colors/spacing.
- **Theme**: Light and dark only; theme controls in shell must switch only between light and dark.

## Steps (Atomic, Chronological)

### Step 9.1: Base Layout Primitives (All Platforms, All Sizes)
**Goal**: Create layout frame components (e.g. AppFrame, AuthFrame, MainFrame) with slot conventions (header, footer, content). One component per platform file; styles in platform `.styles.jsx`; Fluent look and feel.

**Actions**:
1. Create layout category folder under `src/platform/layouts/` (e.g. `frames/`). Per `component-structure.mdc`, each layout component in its own folder with `.android.jsx`, `.ios.jsx`, `.web.jsx`, matching `.styles.jsx`, hook, `types.js`, `index.js`.
2. Implement frames to be responsive: use theme breakpoints and spacing tokens; test at mobile, tablet, desktop, large.
3. Use only theme tokens; Microsoft Fluent styling (subtle radius, light shadows/borders).
4. Export from platform layouts barrel; wire into route group `_layout.jsx` files (import from `@platform/layouts`).

**Verification**: Frames render on Android, iOS, Web; responsive at all breakpoints; pass a11y and theme checks. Tests per `testing.mdc`.

**Rule Reference**: `component-structure.mdc`, `theme-design.mdc`, `platform-ui.mdc`

### Step 9.2: Global Header (All Platforms, All Sizes)
**Goal**: Header component(s) with title, actions, optional breadcrumbs. Platform-separated; responsive; Fluent styling; safe area and a11y.

**Actions**:
1. Create header in `src/platform/components/` under a category folder (e.g. `navigation/`). Full platform file set and barrel.
2. Implement for all screen sizes (e.g. compact on mobile, full on desktop); use breakpoints and tokens.
3. Integrate into layout slots in all relevant route group layouts; ensure no runtime errors.

**Verification**: Header renders on all platforms and sizes; theme and i18n applied; tests per `testing.mdc`.

**Rule Reference**: `component-structure.mdc`, `theme-design.mdc`, `accessibility.mdc`

---

### Step 9.3: Global Footer (All Platforms, All Sizes)
**Goal**: Footer component(s) for status, legal, quick actions. Platform-separated; responsive; Fluent styling.

**Actions**:
1. Create footer in `src/platform/components/` (category folder). Full platform set and barrel.
2. Integrate into layout slots for auth, main, and any other route groups. Verify no mounting errors.

**Verification**: Footer renders on all platforms and sizes; tests per `testing.mdc`.

**Rule Reference**: `component-structure.mdc`, `theme-design.mdc`

---

### Step 9.4: Primary Navigation Shell (All Platforms, All Sizes)
**Goal**: Navigation (drawer/tab/rail as appropriate) for main (and patient) route groups. Platform-appropriate patterns; Fluent look and feel; wired to real layouts.

**Actions**:
1. Implement navigation components per `component-structure.mdc` (platform separation, category folder).
2. Responsive behavior: e.g. bottom tabs on mobile, rail or top nav on desktop; use breakpoints.
3. Wire into route group layouts; guards/roles from app state; all routes reachable, no runtime errors.

**Verification**: Navigation works on all platforms and sizes; tests per `testing.mdc`.

**Rule Reference**: `app-router.mdc`, `platform-ui.mdc`, `theme-design.mdc`

---

### Step 9.5: Theme Controls (Light/Dark Only)
**Goal**: UI controls to switch between light and dark theme; wired to theme state; persist preference. No high-contrast or other theme variants.

**Actions**:
1. Add theme toggle/selector to shell (e.g. header or settings). Only two options: light, dark.
2. Wire to Redux (or theme provider) and persistence; changing theme updates UI without errors.
3. Per `theme-design.mdc`: only light and dark themes exist.

**Verification**: Theme switch works; preference persists; no hydration/render errors.

**Rule Reference**: `theme-design.mdc`, `bootstrap-config.mdc`

---

### Step 9.6: Language Selection Controls
**Goal**: Language selector in shell; wired to i18n; persist selection; all UI text via i18n.

**Actions**:
1. Add language selector to shell; wire to i18n context and persistence.
2. Ensure all layout/shell text uses i18n keys (no hardcoded strings).
3. Switching language updates UI without runtime errors.

**Verification**: Language switch works; persistence works; tests per `i18n.mdc` and `testing.mdc`.

**Rule Reference**: `i18n.mdc`, `accessibility.mdc`

---

### Step 9.7: Global Banners and Utilities (All Platforms, All Sizes)
**Goal**: Offline/online banner, maintenance banner, loading overlay, toast/notice surface. Platform-separated where applicable; responsive; Fluent styling.

**Actions**:
1. Implement banner/overlay/toast components per `component-structure.mdc` (e.g. under `feedback/` or `states/`).
2. Integrate into layouts; mount/unmount safely across route groups.
3. Use theme tokens and Fluent look and feel; a11y per `accessibility.mdc`.

**Verification**: Banners and utilities work on all platforms and sizes; no unhandled errors.

**Rule Reference**: `platform-ui.mdc`, `theme-design.mdc`, `errors-logging.mdc`

---

### Step 9.8: Responsive and Fluent Verification
**Goal**: Confirm all layouts and global UI work at every breakpoint and on every platform with Microsoft Fluent look and feel.

**Actions**:
1. Test each layout and global component at mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), desktop (1024px+), large (1440px+).
2. Test on Android, iOS, Web (or simulators).
3. Verify tokens and styling match Fluent (primary blue, neutrals, typography, radius, elevation).
4. Run full test suite; fix any failures; ensure 100% coverage for new code per `testing.mdc`.

**Verification**: Checklist passed for platforms and breakpoints; tests green; Fluent compliance confirmed.

**Rule Reference**: `theme-design.mdc`, `performance.mdc`, `testing.mdc`
