# Phase 7: App Shell (App Router + Guards + Navigation Skeleton)

## Purpose
Wire the **app shell** infrastructure: providers, app bootstrap, routing groups, guards, and navigation skeleton. This phase establishes the foundational infrastructure that will support app-specific routes and screens created in Phase 10 and Phase 11.

**Note**: This phase does **not** create app-specific routes or screens (e.g., landing, login, home). Those are implemented in Phase 10 (Core Features) and Phase 11 (Screens & Routes). This phase focuses solely on reusable infrastructure.

  - Redirects to login route if unauthenticated (using `router.replace()` from `expo-router`)
  - Accepts optional redirect path parameter (defaults to `/login` as placeholder; actual route path will be determined in Phase 10/11)
  - Returns auth state (authenticated boolean, user data if available)
- Hook should be idempotent and safe to call multiple times

- Export `useRoleGuard` hook per `hooks-utils.mdc`:
  - Accepts required role(s) as parameter
  - Checks if user has required role (via Redux selector or hook per `hooks-utils.mdc`)
  - Accepts optional redirect path parameter for access denied (defaults to `/home` as placeholder; actual route path will be determined in Phase 10/11)
  - Redirects to safe route if access denied per `security.mdc`
  - Exposes error code via state/return value
  - Returns access state (hasAccess boolean, error code if denied)
- **Note**: Redirect paths should match the actual routes created in Phase 10/11

**Expected Outcome**:

- **Coverage**: 100% coverage required (critical path: auth/access control per `testing.mdc`)
- **Verification**: Tests pass, 100% coverage achieved, all branches tested before proceeding to Step 7.14

---

### Step 7.14: Wire auth guard in auth layout
**Goal**: Redirect authenticated users away from auth routes (e.g., login when already logged in).

**Rule References**:
- Guard placement: `app-router.mdc` (guards in layouts, not screens)
- Import aliases: `coding-conventions.mdc` (use `@navigation` alias)

**Actions**:
- In `src/app/(auth)/_layout.jsx`:
  - Import `useAuthGuard` from `@navigation/guards` per `coding-conventions.mdc`
  - Call the hook per `app-router.mdc`
  - If authenticated, redirect to home route (redirect path should match the actual home route created in Phase 10/11)

**Expected Outcome**:

- In `src/app/(main)/_layout.jsx`:
  - Import `useAuthGuard` from `@navigation/guards` per `coding-conventions.mdc`
  - Call the hook at the top of the component per `app-router.mdc`
  - If unauthenticated, user will be redirected to login route (redirect path should match the actual login route created in Phase 10 or Phase 11)

**Expected Outcome**:
- Unauthenticated users cannot access main routes (redirected to login)

**Tests (mandatory - per `testing.mdc`)**:
- Create `src/__tests__/app/main-layout-guard.test.js` per `testing.mdc` (mirror source structure)

**Rule References**:
- Guard placement: `app-router.mdc` (guards in layouts, not screens)
- Import aliases: `coding-conventions.mdc` (use `@navigation` alias)

**Actions**:
- Identify routes that need role protection (can be minimal for now; actual routes created in Phase 10 and Phase 11)
- In route group layouts per `app-router.mdc`:
  - Import `useRoleGuard` from `@navigation/guards` per `coding-conventions.mdc`
  - Call guard with required role parameters
  - Guard will handle redirects automatically

**Expected Outcome**:
- Routes with role requirements are protected (when routes exist in Phase 10 and Phase 11)

**Tests (mandatory - per `testing.mdc`)**:
- Create `src/__tests__/navigation/guards/integration.test.js` per `testing.mdc` (mirror source structure)
- Mock `useRoleGuard` hook
- Mock route layouts/components
- Test that role guards work correctly in route contexts (integration test)
- Test that multiple guards can be combined without conflicts (composition test)
- Test all branches (different role combinations, with/without redirect path)

---

### Step 7.17: Integrate navigation skeleton in main layout
**Goal**: Render navigation UI components (Header/TabBar/Sidebar) in main layout.

**Rule References**:
- Platform UI: `platform-ui.mdc` (platform-specific components, file-level separation)
- Import aliases: `coding-conventions.mdc` (use `@platform` alias)
- Accessibility: `accessibility.mdc` (a11y labels, focus order, touch targets)
- Responsive design: `theme-design.mdc` (responsive behavior via breakpoints)

**Actions**:
- In `src/app/(main)/_layout.jsx`:
  - Import navigation components from `@platform/components` per `coding-conventions.mdc` (Header, TabBar, Sidebar)
  - Render navigation components wrapping `<Slot />`
  - Use platform-specific components per `platform-ui.mdc` (web vs mobile navigation via file-level separation)
  - Ensure proper responsive behavior per `theme-design.mdc`

**Expected Outcome**:
- Main routes display navigation skeleton (Header/TabBar on mobile, Sidebar on web, etc.)

**Tests (mandatory - per `testing.mdc`)**:
- Create `src/__tests__/app/main-layout-navigation.test.js` per `testing.mdc` (mirror source structure)
- Test that navigation components render correctly (mock navigation components)
- Test that routes are still accessible with navigation present (mock `<Slot />`)
- Test Web platform: focus order and a11y labels for nav controls are correct per `accessibility.mdc`
- Test all branches (platform-specific rendering)
- Mock platform-specific components; test platform differentiation
- Test accessibility props (`accessibilityLabel`, `testID`) per `testing.mdc`
- **Coverage**: 100% coverage required per `testing.mdc`
- **Verification**: Tests pass, coverage meets `testing.mdc` requirements, all branches tested

---

## Routing Rules (Important)

**Rule Reference**: `app-router.mdc` (route groups, navigation rules)

**Route Grouping (MANDATORY)**:
- **All related routes MUST be grouped** using parentheses `(group-name)` per `.cursor/rules/app-router.mdc`
- Common generic groups: `(auth)`, `(main)`, `(public)`
- **Note**: App-specific route groups (e.g., `(clinical)`, `(admin)`, `(patient)`) should be created in Phase 10+ when implementing HMS features
- Only root routes (`index.jsx`) and error handlers (`+not-found.jsx`, `_error.jsx`) are allowed outside groups
- Each route group MUST have its own `_layout.jsx` for group-specific logic (guards, navigation, etc.)
- See `.cursor/rules/app-router.mdc` for complete requirements

**Navigation Paths**:
When navigating/linking (after routes are created in Phase 10 and Phase 11), **omit group segments** per `app-router.mdc` (do not include `/(auth)` or `/(main)` in user-facing paths):
- ✅ Correct: `router.push('/login')` or `<Link href="/home" />`
- ❌ Incorrect: `router.push('/(auth)/login')` or `<Link href="/(main)/home" />`

**Note**: Actual routes (landing, login, home, index, not-found, etc.) are created in Phase 10 (Core Features) and Phase 11 (Screens & Routes). This phase only establishes the infrastructure (route groups, layouts, guards) that will support those routes.
